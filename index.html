</h1>

<p><strong>VotesApp</strong> is a <em>WhatsApp</em> Bot that helps you and your friends to organize Votes in <em>WhatsApp</em> groups.</p>

<p>As <em>WhatsApp</em> User the probability that you have a group together with some friends is quite huge. If not try it, it's a great feature. And when you are in a group like, it will happend that someone asks a question like, <em>Who likes to join Karting on Saturday?</em>, or <em>Whats about pizza today after work?</em>. Maybe you have such voting once a week for a fixed event like playing soccer in the evinig? Then it becomes quite hard to manage this.</p>

<p>Now you just invite <strong>VotesApp</strong> into your <em>WhatsApp</em> group.
Once joined, <strong>VotesApp</strong> will listen to the Keywords, <code>in</code>, <code>out</code>, <code>yes</code>, <code>no</code> to count votes and <code>status</code> to give the names of the people which voted for this keyword.</p>

<p>This project was triggered because of the <a href="https://github.com/learning-spring-boot/contest">Spring Boot Contest</a>. To keep the judges up to date and show them why we decided like this on some points, we try to keep the diary up to date.</p>

<p>So if you are interested in the huzzle we had, have a look :)</p>

<p>Since today it's the full stack is deployed.</p>

<p>Now your can invite our Test-Number ( <strong>+49 1577 0658227</strong> ) into your groups to start some votes.</p>

<p>Basics votes (and some eastereggs) are supported, see:</p>

<p><img src="diary/firstTest_small.png" alt="Image of our Solution"></p>

<p>Currently you can use the following (essential) instructions:</p>

<li>Yes, No, In, Out, Maybe, +1, 2, 3,4 ..., 0</li>
<li>Reset, Vote</li>

<a id="why-it-took-so-long" class="anchor" href="#why-it-took-so-long" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why it took so long?</h3>

<p>Within the last three days we had strange encoding problems within our deployed python application.
It wasn't really clear whether where the problem is comes from.
We had serval differences (OS, Python-Version, Virtualisation) between our development machine and the server.
The final solution was quite easy, we just need to set the <code>locale</code> correct.
The identification wasn't obvious because the application was running in an docker container and you need to find the right command to execute <code>locale</code>  in our enviorment it's: <code>docker exec -i -t yourName bash</code>.</p>

<p>I think we describe the full stack more detailed in the next days.
We wil also try to make a plugin API (using Spring-Plugin) to support 3rd Party commands :)</p>

<p>Happy testing!</p>

<p><strong>Yes!</strong> We made Yowsup ready to use from our java backend. Here is a screenshot of the communication we did today:</p>

<p><img src="diary/yowsupFiler.png" alt="Image of our first messages"></p>

<p>We are not quite proud that we need to use FileIO to send and receive messages, but thats the limitation we have by yowsup and our python skills.</p>

<p>In the last days we were learning some Python and understanding the Yowsup architecture (which is really great!). We tried to add a ReST Server to yowsup. Finally we regonized that the communication between WhatsApp and Yowsup stopped working when spinning up the <a href="http://bottlepy.org/">Bottle Rest Server</a>.</p>

<p>Because we don't have more time to get more deep into python, we decided to use JSON-Files to instead of an REST server for now. The result should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="diary/fileSolution.jpeg" alt="Image of our file Solution"></p>

<p>The goal is to keep the VotesApp solution (which we submit) on clean. It will not have anything todo with the file io that happens on the right side (because yowsup doesn't have the rest interface yet). If you are intereseted in the python code we added you can find it in <a href="https://github.com/s2team/yowsup/commit/2b24d3fa4ea1b7f821924a48b7ef60084519553e">this</a> commit. But don't take it as an best practice example :).</p>

<p>Now we "only" need to build the middle application what will be not that hard.</p>

<p>Today evening we meet again and summarized the current status.</p>

<p>On the Python we still need to tune some things before releasing it to public. But I can tell you, there is already some nice communication going on.</p>

<p>On the Java we can show already some new things. Since we are using Reactor we also like to use it for our integration tests. The idea is to "replay" incomming WhatsApp Messages and then check the result. In a simple scenario we would like to test that when sending "ping", "pong" should be returned.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-java"><pre>@RunWith(<span class="pl-stj">SpringJUnit4ClassRunner</span><span class="pl-k">.</span>class)
@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-stj">VotesAppApplication</span><span class="pl-k">.</span>class)
@<span class="pl-stj">WebAppConfiguration</span>
<span class="pl-s">public</span> <span class="pl-s">class</span> <span class="pl-en">VotesAppApplicationTest</span> {

  <span class="pl-st">@Autowired</span>
  <span class="pl-stj">Reactor</span> reactor;

  <span class="pl-st">@Test</span>
  <span class="pl-s">public</span> <span class="pl-st">void</span> <span class="pl-en">ping_pong_test</span>() <span class="pl-s">throws</span> <span class="pl-stj">InterruptedException</span> {
    reactor<span class="pl-k">.</span>notify(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>group.inbox<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, <span class="pl-stj">Event</span><span class="pl-k">.</span>wrap(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Ping<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>));

    <span class="pl-c">// If the integration works well, the business logic should answer with "Pong" to "group.outbox"</span>

    <span class="pl-c">// does not exist like this (yet :( )</span>
    assertThat(reactor, receives(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Pong<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)<span class="pl-k">.</span>in(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>group.outbox<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>));
  }
}</pre></div>

<p>When doing so we haven't found an <em>elegant</em> way to <code>assertThat</code> a <code>GroupMessage</code>-Event was raised.
The cool thing is that the authors <a href="https://github.com/smaldini" class="user-mention">@smaldini</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jbrisbin" class="user-mention">@jbrisbin</a> <a href="https://github.com/reactor/reactor/issues/415#issuecomment-69263171">liked the Idea</a> and we will maybe see it in some time.
Until then we are doing it with some <code>obj.notify()</code> and <code>obj.wait()</code> magic in our <a href="src/test/java/de/votesapp/VotesAppUserTests_Test.java">integration test</a></p>

<p>Another neat experience we had was the integration of an embedded mongodb for our integration tests.</p>

<p>The only change we need made was adding this dependency <code>com.github.fakemongo:fongo:1.5.9</code> and putting the following configuration for our tests:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-java"><pre>@<span class="pl-stj">Configuration</span>
<span class="pl-s">static</span> <span class="pl-s">class</span> <span class="pl-en">MongoDbTestConfiguration</span> <span class="pl-s">extends</span> <span class="pl-e">AbstractMongoConfiguration</span> {

  <span class="pl-st">@Override</span>
  <span class="pl-s">protected</span> <span class="pl-stj">String</span> <span class="pl-en">getDatabaseName</span>() {
    <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>test<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;
  }

  <span class="pl-st">@Override</span>
  <span class="pl-s">public</span> <span class="pl-stj">Mongo</span> <span class="pl-en">mongo</span>() {
    <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-k">new</span> <span class="pl-stj">Fongo</span>(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>mongo<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)<span class="pl-k">.</span>getMongo();
  }

  <span class="pl-st">@Override</span>
  <span class="pl-s">protected</span> <span class="pl-stj">String</span> <span class="pl-en">getMappingBasePackage</span>() {
    <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>de.votesapp<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;
  }
}</pre></div>

<p>Because we currently don't need a real database, we decided to put it into the main configuration as long as we haven't finished the database integration and deployed it to p.</p>

<p>As usual there is a good news and a bad news. Let's start with the bad one, because we learned that the last thing you, tell stays in our minds :)</p>

<p>Bad News: We still have some huzzle with the Python Backend. But we think we can finish it by tomorrow and then fully concentrate on the contest`s goal (Java/Spring Boot)!</p>

<p>Good News: To avoid having nothing by now, we added a simple <a href="src/main/java/de/votesapp/client/ConsoleClient.java">"ConsoleClient"</a> to fake the WhatsApp Service. That gets loaded when the "yowsup" Profile isn't active. For this we utilized the <code>!</code> operator within the <code>@Profile</code>-Annotation.</p>

<p><img src="diary/notInProfile.png" alt="Image of Not in Profiles"></p>

<p>With this we can have our first vote, which proofs that some logic is already working:</p>

<p><img src="diary/succedInTheContest.png" alt="Image of our first vote"></p>

<p>To do so, we decided to remove the interfaces we had previously between our API and WhatsApp and use <a href="https://github.com/reactor/reactor">reactor</a> instead.</p>

<p>The <a href="src/main/java/de/votesapp/api/WhatsAppClientToReactorBridge.java">"Bridge"</a> between our <a href="src/main/java/de/votesapp/client/ConsoleClient.java">"ConsoleClient"</a> and Reactor looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="diary/reactorExample.png" alt="Reactor Example"></p>

<p>We are looking forward to do more stuff on the Java site within the next days.</p>

<p>Two days ago we met again on an epic go cart event and we had some time to discuss the next steps. We figured out that the yowsup architecture seems to be pretty nice (in terms of flexibility and readability). So we decided that we take the risk, drop Plan A (from 31.12.) and implement "only" a nice Rest-API on top off yowsup. With this the actual Java Code, what the contest is about, stays much cleaner.</p>

<p>With this in mind we decided that one of us will put a ReST-Layer in Python and the other one will go for the Java Code.</p>

<p>The result of today are a view java packages:</p>

<p><img src="diary/firstPackages.png" alt="Image of our first packages"></p>

<p>They are far away from production-ready, but they show already the way it will go.</p>

<p>On the python/yowsup side we know how to deal with the native events, we know how to send messages and where to register our own methods. The next step will to dig deeper into how to put the ReST-Layer on-top on it.</p>

<p>Today we decided to put our diary online. Also if there is no code yet, we hope it will be interesting enough :).</p>

<p>Funny background, we just registered the domain for the VotesApp. And this is how we decided who as the pleasure to register it and become the domain owner:</p>

<p>Over the night, more and more people commented on the <a href="https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/issues/370"><em>no_route</em> ticket mentioned</a> yesterday. We saw that <a href="https://github.com/tgalal" class="user-mention">@tgalal</a> was working hard on yowsup but somehow he isn't giving feedback on the registration bug.</p>

<p>When sit together and talking about this, we decided that the broken registration is a show stopper and we need about alternatives.</p>

<p>It seemed that Androids <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_ui.html#uianalysis">uiautomatorviewer</a> is the way to go. From our past we know that working with the Android Emulator isn't that nice for newbees (specially if you need to reboot the device often). Anyway we saw the Challenge and started installing the Android SDK, booted the Emulator and installed <em>WhatsApp</em> on it.</p>

<p>And hell, yeah! The uiautomatorviewer was able to parse the emulators screen give us needed ui elements content.</p>

<p><img src="diary/UiAutomatorViewer.png" alt="Image of our UiAutomatorViewer"></p>

<p>Okay, the screenshot was black, but the ui structure was visible and showing its texts.</p>

<p>But then the next challenge started, how to remotecontrol (navigate) this "thing" now? Since we have great Selenium skills, we thought of using the selendroid library to do this. But before going to deep into Android development we had the idea to register manual (on the phone) and then continue using yowsup.</p>

<p>Sounds easy, but the <em>simple</em> solutions we found required us to have a rooted android phone. So we tried to root our Android Emulator but it wasn't possible on windows (at least for us). Luckly we found <a href="http://www.digitalinternals.com/security/extract-*WhatsApp*-password-android/374/">this article</a> telling us how to access the emulators disk to download <em>WhatsApp</em>s highly secured passwordfile and read it. :)</p>

<p>That enabled us to send and receive messages over the yowsup-cli.</p>

<p>Okay, that wasn't the full story. We need also to apply this awesome bugfix (we will not share it with the public of course :):
<img src="diary/awesomeBugfix.png" alt="Image of our s/rase/print/g"></p>

<p>The said story of the day is that the yowsup-cli provides group interaction in the "interactive" mode only. Now the question is how to continue?</p>

<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Manual Registration via Emulator with the help of <a href="http://www.digitalinternals.com/security/extract-*WhatsApp*-password-android/374/">this</a> was possible</li>

<p>On thursday the first huzzle started. In the evening I tried to prepare yowsup (the inoffical <em>WhatsApp</em> library written in python) to focus on java when we meet the next time. But already at the installation of the library I got (for a java devs) strange "Tracebacks".</p>

<p>The solution, ... <code>sudo apt-get install python python-dateutil python-argparse python-setuptools</code>
... was easy, (if you know it :) ), some common dependencies where missing on my pc.</p>

<p>But it was worth it, I think <a href="https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/issues/464#issuecomment-68265182">our comment</a> lead into this commit:
<a href="https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/commit/939af7b9101d6cada50e135710fa6032f67e5921">https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/commit/939af7b9101d6cada50e135710fa6032f67e5921</a></p>

<p>So our project had the first public benefit :).</p>

<p>But that was not everything.</p>

<p>Once was installed, the first step you need to execute failed because of an <em>no_route</em> error. The disappointing thing was, that we found <a href="https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/issues/370">a ticket</a> that was filed Nov. 19th and is still not solved.</p>

<p>But who said it should be easy...?</p>

<p>P.S.: My real huzzle was that I'm working on OSX and tried on the same day(s) Docker and Vagrant to get a nice Ubuntu Enviorment to play with :) <em>-cough-</em></p>

Damn, it! How are we gonna name this thing?</h2>

<p>Today we meet the first time to kick-off the project. We roughly talked about the things we can demonstrate with this idea and made a small analyses which API-Calls we need. When we thought we have everything, we start implementing a first mock in Java.</p>

<p>The list of things we could show looks like this:</p>

<p>Our app will (<em>hopfully</em> :) )...,</p>

<ul>
<li>be a neat and sweat backend service (focus on spring boot, not on UI)</li>
<li>have a decent business layer (not too much to program)</li>
<li>talk/integration another services (advantage of Spring)</li>
<li>be possible to deploy at Cloud-Foundary (or smth. similiar)</li>
<li>be easy to test for the judges (common requierement)</li>
<li>solve a real problem (personal requierment)</li>
</ul>

<p>Our first API draft looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="diary/api1.jpg" alt="Image of our API 1">
<img src="diary/api2.jpg" alt="Image of our API 2"></p>

<p>*<em>But, *</em> when we start mocking, the first problem hit us, - How are we going to call our baby?</p>

<p>We tought about the goal of the project (finding dates) in combination with the servers we are coupled with, - WhatApp. Since we use <em>doodle</em> to organize our LaserTag events (ya, thats we the nerds will joins and we can use tools like this, ...) we combined 1 and 1. <em>WhatsApp</em> and Doodle is: Whoodle. Later we recongnized the Whoodle is a dog breed so we renamed it to:</p>

<p><strong>-- VotesApp :)</strong></p>

<p>After mocking the java side (where we know our challanges)
we start searching for the <em>WhatsApp</em> integration.
Since this is not what the contest is about, we hoped for a java libary
that has a nice API and is easy to use.</p>

<p>The good news was, we found the <a href="https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup">yowsup</a> api which sounds promising (1,5k stars), the "not so good" news was, it's written in Python and doesn't have an easy to use webservice (by now).</p>

<p>Today we also got <a href="https://github.com/learning-spring-boot/contest/issues/1">the offical</a> "go" to join the contest in a team, - yeye :)</p>
